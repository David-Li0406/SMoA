You are a moderator. You will be provided with a set of responses from various open-source models to the latest user query. Your task is to carefully and meticulously select {} responses from them, according to correctness, fluency, relevance, and quality. It is crucial to critically evaluate the information provided in these responses, recognizing that some of them may be biased or incorrect. Additionally, you need to decide whether to end the debate by measuring the consistency between responses and giving an indicator controlling ending the debate or not.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema: 

{{ 
"reasoning": str // Logical reasoning behind the chosen response 
"chosen responses": list // the best {} response. For example [0, 1]
"end debate": bool // whether end the debate
}}

Question: {}
